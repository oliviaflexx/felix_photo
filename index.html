                            Craig Felix is a commercial product photographer for a national specialty department store based in Wisconsin.  He was born in St. Lucia, West Indies, and came to Milwaukee at age 19 to attend Marquette University where he studied economics. He completed a BA in economics, and a year later married his wife Michelle. They have two children, Olivia and Nicholas.  In 2001, Craig’s love of photography motivated him to turn his hobby into a career. He returned to school for two years to take photography classes at Milwaukee Area Technical College. Soon after, he began working as a photographer’s assistant and then a professional photographer. Craig is also a FAA -Certified Drone Pilot.  His love of travel has greatly inspired his photography.

                            Growing up on the island of St. Lucia, I was not exposed to much art as a young child. I was, however, surrounded by tremendous natural beauty, a fact that I didn’t fully appreciate until after I had moved from St. Lucia and returned years later. I had also discovered photography as a hobby at the time that I began returning home to St. Lucia on a yearly basis.
                            I immensely enjoy travel photography using natural light and perspective to capture the beauty of a scene and to engage my viewers’ interest.  In addition to St. Lucia, I have traveled to France, Italy, Jamaica, Canada and several states across the USA.
                            As a photographer, I am able to “see” through the camera lens. I have just as much fun taking pictures during my travels as I do creating unique portfolio images of products. I find such joy in the expression on kids’ faces, beautiful light falling on a leaf or a scarf, as well as snow covered parks. Beauty is all around us. We can travel thousands of miles to look for it or look outside our backyard. For fun I choose to go further. I am excited to share my images with you. Enjoy!
